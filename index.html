    <p>Traditional Christmas dinner features turkey with stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce and vegetables. But everyone adapted Christmas menu to their tastes so nothing to worry about.   I suggest that you do on Christmas and New Year's Day your favorite dish that you cook best for others to enjoy. Year-end festive seasons  is about giving and sharing so eat, drink and be merry with all the festive recipes that you can customize to your and your loved onesâ€™ taste and have a zoom session with your friends who can't come to see you that day.</p>

    <p>This can take all your creativity and different shapes and forms: you can surprise your loved ones  extending to them Christmas greetings or use social media to send your personalized Christmas video message or picture with the family to your friends from overseas. Christmas is celebrated with Christmas tree and people singing carols as the festival aims to spread the message of peace and prosperity. You can create your own Christmas song and customize any tree with your own ornaments specially for the occasion.</p>
